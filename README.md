### Scene Descriptions ###

General descriptions on which scene contains which contents can be found in the following. A complete gamethrough as it should be in builds is: 

<center><b>Persistent -> MainMenu -> Game -> Credits -> MainMenu</b></center>  
  
 * **Persistent**: The persistent scene is a container scene, which holds objects that should be alive during the hole game cycle, beginning with starting and ending with closing the game. In order to simulate a realistic run, you should start at this point.

 * **MainMenu**: The actual entry point. Here, games can be started as well as continued and additionally, user specific preferences (e.g. sound settings) can be entered.

 * **Game**: The actual game, containing the world and all logics.

 * **Credits**: Contains the credits, which are shown after a complete playthrough.
